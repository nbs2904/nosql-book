 abstract = {This book is an easy-to-follow, hands-on introduction that guides you through this innovative new technology. It covers everything from data grids to the simple-to-use distributed data storage collections. Queuing and topic messaging capabilities, as well as locking and transaction support to guard against concurrency race-conditions, are some of the topics that we will cover. We will then move on to distributed task execution, in-place data manipulations and big data analytical processing using MapReduce. At the end of all this, you will be armed with everything you need to bring amazing power and data scalability to your applications, as well as making them truly global and ready for a worldwide audience.},
